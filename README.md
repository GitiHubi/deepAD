Detection of Accounting Anomalies in the Latent Space using Adversarial Autoencoder Neural Networks - A lab we prepared for the 2nd KDD'19 Workshop on Anomaly Detection in Finance that will walk you through the detection of interpretable accounting anomalies using adversarial autoencoder neural networks. The majority of the lab content is based on Jupyter Notebook, Python and PyTorch.

The workshop details are available via the KDD'19 workshop webpage under the following [external link](https://sites.google.com/view/kdd-adf-2019).
